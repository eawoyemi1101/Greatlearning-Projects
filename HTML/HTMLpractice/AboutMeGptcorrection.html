    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello. My Name is Emmanuel Awoyemi. I am currently a Junior at Woodbury high school who is a part of the PSEO program at Bethel University. My favorite subjects are Math, Physics, and Chem. I also love learning about technology and software engineering. I want to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a specialization in Quantum Technology and systems, move out to California, work at a high level in a big company for a while, then break off of them and start my own.</p>
